xv6 is a re-implementation of Dennis Ritchie's and Ken Thompson's Unix
Version 6 (v6).  xv6 loosely follows the structure and style of v6,
but is implemented for a modern x86-based multiprocessor using ANSI C.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

xv6 is inspired by John Lions's Commentary on UNIX 6th Edition (Peer
to Peer Communications; ISBN: 1-57398-013-7; 1st edition (June 14,
2000)). See also http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2016/xv6.html, which
provides pointers to on-line resources for v6.

xv6 borrows code from the following sources:
    JOS (asm.h, elf.h, mmu.h, bootasm.S, ide.c, console.c, and others)
    Plan 9 (entryother.S, mp.h, mp.c, lapic.c)
    FreeBSD (ioapic.c)
    NetBSD (console.c)

The following people have made contributions: Russ Cox (context switching,
locking), Cliff Frey (MP), Xiao Yu (MP), Nickolai Zeldovich, and Austin
Clements.

ERROR REPORTS

Please send errors and suggestions to Frans Kaashoek and Robert Morris
(kaashoek,rtm@mit.edu). The main purpose of xv6 is as a teaching
operating system for MIT's 6.828, so we are more interested in
simplifications and clarifications than new features.

BUILDING AND RUNNING XV6 ON RASPBERRY PI 3
#Run the following commands: 
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install git zlib1g-dev libsdl1.2-dev

# Install a cross-compiler gcc
$ apt-get install -y gcc-arm-none-eabi 

# Install qemu emulator which is compatible with ARM architecture
$ apt-get install -y qemu-system-arm

# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/AnvithShetty10/xv6_rpi3_port.git xv6_rpi3

$ cd xv6_rpi3
$ make
$ make qemu

# The xv6 interface will appear on the QEMU platform
